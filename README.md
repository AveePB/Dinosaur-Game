# Dinosaur Game
This is a recreation of the popular Google Chrome dinosaur game built using the Pygame library in Python. 
The game features a small T-Rex dinosaur that runs and jumps over obstacles like cactuses and birds.

## How to Play:
To start the game, simply run the main.py: 
```
python main.py.

- The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible by avoiding obstacles. 
- The dinosaur runs automatically, and you can make it jump by pressing the up arrow and
you can make it bend down by pressing the down arrow.
- You need to time your jumps carefully to avoid hitting obstacles like cactuses and birds.
- The game ends when you hit an obstacle, and your score 
is the distance that you managed to cover.
- You can restart the game by pressing the space bar.

## Prerequisites:
To run the game, you need to have Python 3.11 and Pygame installed on your computer.
